# react-swiftui

SwiftUI has really nice API. You can build UIs by combination of `Text`, `HStack`, `VStack` and many more. When I first saw it, it reminded me of Flexbox model of course.

This library lets you build web apps by using SwiftUI-like API. It will translate into standard CSS, but the idea is that you don't have to write CSS.

## Why use this?

- Use same building blocks as you would use on Apple platforms. This is almost as if you were using the same language to describe your UIs!
- Don't write CSS. Don't switch between languages, and don't switch between files. Describe your UI with one language.
- Prototype rapidly. It might be harder to get those pixel-perfect details right, but this library would be perfect for making an app in a single evening.
